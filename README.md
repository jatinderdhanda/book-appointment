Areas of Improvements:

1) Error Handling: Implement more specific and structured error handling throughout the application. Instead of throwing generic exceptions, consider creating custom exception types for different error scenarios to provide better context to the caller.

2) PipelineBehavior: Implement mediatr pipeline behavior to define generic behavior for all handlers to handle error, validation and logging.

3) Input Validation: Enhance input validation to ensure that all user inputs are validated properly to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Validate input formats, ranges, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

4) Unit Testing: Increase test coverage by writing more comprehensive unit tests.
